# Weather_with-you
A little weather app that lets you find out all you need to know when you are travelling around
You will be able to search for a city via the form on the webpage for any city you are in or about to visit.
It will tell you the current and future weather conditions and the city is added to your search history so that you can revisit that information quickly.
It will present you with the city name, date, weather icon indicating condtions, uv index, windspeed etc - Everything you need to know

The UV index rating will show you in a colour format whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe
Future weather conditions will give you a 5 day forecast.
